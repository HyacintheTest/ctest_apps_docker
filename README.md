# Dockerisation de symfony3

* install docker
* install docker compose
* pull git repo
* ``cd ctest_apps_docker``
* build and launch your containers with init.sh:
	⋅⋅+ `chmod +x *.sh`
	⋅⋅+ `sudo ./init.sh`
* This should take some time. Why wouldn't you grab a coffee? ^_^
* The symfony application is available at `localhost:3000/app_dev.php` and phpmyadmin at `localhost:4000`
